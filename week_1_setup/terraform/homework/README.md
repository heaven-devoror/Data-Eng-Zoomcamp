## Terraform homework

**Go to google cloud console and start the vm instance**

Copy the external ip address and update your config file with the
new ip address

Connect to it using VS code Remote ssh and authenticate yourself

Clone the data_engeenering_zoomcamp repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp.git
```

Downloading Terraform binray for suitable architecture
```bash
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.7/terraform_1.3.7_linux_amd64.zip
```

Create a bin folder and move terraform file there after unziping it
```bash
mkdir bin
cd bin
mv ~/terraform_1.3.7_linux_amd64.zip ~/bin/
unzip terraform_1.3.7_linux_amd64.zip
rm terraform_1.3.7_linux_amd64.zip
```

> Assuming bin folder is already on path
<pre>export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"</pre>

Go to week1 terraform folder
```bash
cd data-engineering-zoomcamp/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform/
```

Checking what files are there
```bash
ls
README.md  main.tf  variables.tf
```

```bash
terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/google from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/google v4.49.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Checking if everthing went well

  Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
